The created PDF will have as few pages as possible, in many cases only one. This is useful if you are exporting your notebook to a PDF for sharing with others who will view them on a screen.\n",

This mean you need to use Acrobat Reader or pdf.js to be able to get the attachment from the PDF. Preview for OSX does not know how to display/give you access to PDF attachments."
